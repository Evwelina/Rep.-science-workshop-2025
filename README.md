# Rep.-science-workshop-2025
Assignment 2 in BIO415, R course 2025, made by Evelina. To save myself the sanity, I decided to use a previous live coding session as my code of choice. 
In this live coding session, we wanted to get a better understanding of multiple regression by analysing data of butterfly-fish. Data for this project includes LawtonDataForR.csv which is available in the GitHub 'data/' directory.
# How to reproduce 
1. Clone or download this repository. 
2. Open the ."Rproj" file in RStudio. 
Install the required R packages (first time only): install.packages(c("tidyverse","car","GGally","performance"))

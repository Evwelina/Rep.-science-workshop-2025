# Rep.-science-workshop-2025
Assignment 2 in BIO415, R course 2025, made by Evelina. To save myself the sanity, I decided to use a previous live coding session as my code of choice. 
In this live coding session, we wanted to get a better understanding of multiple regression by analysing data of butterfly-fish. Data for this project includes LawtonDataForR.csv which is available in the GitHub directory.
